# 👋🏻 Hi, let me introduce myself

I'm Iraivel, a data professional with a geophysicist background interpretating data. 🌎

In 2022 I transitioned to Data Science, pursuing my passion for working with numbers and analyzing data. ❤️

I like the challenge of learning new skills, it could be watching video tutorials or like the old school: reading textbooks. 📖

Through this platform, I'd like to share my journey in this career path. 🌟
